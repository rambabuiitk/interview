/**
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.
 *
 * Introduction
 * A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
 *
 * A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences
 *
 * All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
 * The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesnâ€™t have to be a full binary tree.
 *
 * Input: [4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The last level is not filled from left.
 *
 * Input: [12, 7, 1, 9, null, 10, 5]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The last level nodes are not lean towards left.
